## 🌌 Overview

*Sanchara Vyuha* (“Network of Motion”) is an *AI-powered urban transit grid* designed to revolutionize bus transportation system through *real-time analytics, predictive dispatching, and smart commuter integration*.  
The project integrates *computer vision, machine learning, and data-driven intelligence* to ensure *optimized routes, reduced wait times, and adaptive mobility operations*.

---

## 🌆 Vision

Public transport system caters to millions daily but operates on *static schedules* that don’t reflect *live commuter demand*.  
*Sanchara Vyuha* envisions a future where *AI-driven adaptive scheduling* and *real-time passenger data* guide every bus movement, creating an *intelligent, responsive, and efficient city transit ecosystem*.

---

## 🚨 Problem Statement

Despite BMTC’s wide reach and infrastructure:  

- Buses are often *overcrowded or underutilized*.  
- Commuters face *unpredictable wait times*.  
- Depot staff lack *real-time demand visibility*.  
- Existing systems are *static and not predictive*.  

---

## 💡 Proposed Solution

The project introduces a *multi-layered AI-powered architecture* integrating the following components:

1. *CCTV-Based Passenger Detection*  
   Real-time passenger counting using *YOLOv8* and *OpenCV*, generating structured data for analytics.

2. *Centralized Data & API Layer*  
   *Flask backend* for live updates, data preprocessing, and seamless integration with the dashboard and commuter app.

3. *Smart Bus Dispatch Engine*  
   Driven by *GRU, GBM, and LSTM models* to forecast demand, identify peak hours, and recommend bus dispatch.

## 🧩 System Modules

### Depot Dashboard

An interactive dashboard built with *Plotly Dash* displaying:

- Live passenger counts  
- Route heatmaps  
- Historical demand trends  
- AI-based dispatch suggestions  

### Commuter App

A *Flutter-based prototype* providing:

- Live bus tracking  
- Occupancy status visualization  
- Smart journey planning assistance

## 🧠 AI System & Models

| Model | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| *GRU (Gated Recurrent Unit)* | Predicts real-time passenger flow using sequential ETM and CCTV data. |
| *GBM (Gradient Boosting Machine)* | Optimizes decisions using multiple route and demand metrics. |
| *LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)* | Identifies peak-hour patterns and aids the AI Agent in dynamic scheduling. |
| *AI Agent* | Combines GRU, GBM, and LSTM outputs to determine optimal bus dispatching. |

---

## 🔄 Real-Time Data Workflow

1. CCTV cameras stream passenger data to *YOLOv8* for detection.  
2. Processed data is sent to *Flask backend → stored in Firebase/MongoDB*.  
3. Dashboard visualizes *live metrics and predictions*.  
4. AI Dispatch Engine computes *bus allocation decisions*.  
5. Commuter App displays *live bus and occupancy updates* to passengers.
