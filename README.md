Overview:

Sanchara Vyuha (‚ÄúNetwork of Motion‚Äù) is an intelligent urban transit grid designed to transform Bengaluru‚Äôs bus network through AI-driven decision-making, real-time passenger analytics, and dynamic bus dispatching.

The system combines computer vision, machine learning, and predictive analytics to optimize routes, reduce wait times, and create a responsive, data-driven public transport ecosystem.

Vision
Bengaluru‚Äôs public buses serve millions daily, yet operate on fixed schedules that fail to match live passenger demand.
Sanchara Vyuha envisions an AI-powered adaptive system where each bus movement is driven by real-time commuter insights ‚Äî turning raw data into intelligent, actionable mobility decisions.

Problem Statement
Despite BMTC‚Äôs scale and reach:
Buses often run overcrowded or underutilized.
Commuters face unpredictable wait times.
Staff lack live visibility into demand and crowd flow.
Systems are static, not predictive.

Proposed Solution

Sanchara Vyuha introduces a multi-layer AI-powered architecture that integrates:

CCTV-Based Passenger Detection:
Real-time passenger counting using YOLOv8 and OpenCV, generating structured JSON outputs for backend processing.
Centralized Data & API Layer:
Flask-based backend handling live updates, data cleaning, and API access for dashboard and app integration.
Smart Bus Dispatch Engine:
Powered by GRU, GBM, and LSTM models that forecast passenger density, identify peak hours, and recommend bus allocation.

Depot Dashboard:
An interactive dashboard that visualizes real-time passenger data, heatmaps, historical trends, and dispatch suggestions.

Commuter App Prototype:
Built using Flutter, showing live bus tracking, occupancy visualization, and journey planning options.

AI System & Models
GRU (Gated Recurrent Unit): Learns sequential data from CCTV and ETM onboarding patterns to predict real-time crowd flow.
GBM (Gradient Boosting Machine): Optimizes decision-making using multiple route and demand parameters.
LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory): Predicts peak-hour passenger spikes and assists the AI Agent in dynamic dispatching.
AI Agent: The decision core combining outputs from GRU, GBM, and LSTM to determine where and when buses should be allocated.
Real-Time Data Workflow
CCTV cameras stream live data to the YOLOv8 detection model.
Passenger counts are sent to the Flask backend and stored in Firebase/MongoDB.
The dashboard visualizes live updates and predictive analytics.
The AI Dispatch Engine processes data and triggers smart bus allocation.
Commuter app displays real-time information to passengers.

Technology Stack

AI / ML: YOLOv8, OpenCV, TensorFlow, GRU, GBM, LSTM
Backend: Python, Flask, REST APIs
Database: Firebase Realtime DB, MongoDB
